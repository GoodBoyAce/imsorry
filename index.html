    <h3>Truth is.. after we stop talking, i start missing you. instantly.</h3>
    <h3>I'm very wrong for letting feelings bottled up and releasing them at the tipping point</h3>
    <h3>I'm looking into therapy to help process it because i don't want to upset you anymore than I have.</h3>
    <h3>I'd do anything to keep you here. You told you me that you dont see us ever getting together but never not see us being friends.</h3>
    <h3>I never want to see you not in my life because you are a very close friend and someone I cherish.</h3>
